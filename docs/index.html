        &nbsp;Caffeinated Climbing prides itself on bringing together two separate communities, those who are interested in rock climbing, backpacking, and overall outdoor activities compare to those who prefer simple pleasures like enjoying a nice cup of coffee on their couch or cracking open a nice cold soda with a delicious meal. By bringing these communities together allows individuals who think they are complete polar opposites actually have much more in common. We focus on helping those who are interested in outdoor activities either start their journey or look for locations that are a bit more nicer to the wallets while also trying to engage with our audience that before to lay back with a nice cup of coffee and take it easy, so by creating our own brand of beverages they are able to enjoy the rich taste of our ground beans imported from all over the world or even better enjoying these two hobbies together.
